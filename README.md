# Credit Risk Analysis
*10 Oct 2021*

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to utilize imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build models and evalute them using a resampling method in an effort to predict credit risk. In the first section of the project, the data was first under sampled, then over sampled to create a model. In the second portion, a combination method was used to create a model. The results were then compared to gauge the accuracy, precision and recall scores.
